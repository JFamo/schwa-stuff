			<p class="bodyText1">
				One of the most challenging events that TSA has to offer is 3D Animation - it had just three participants in the state last year. This year, B. Cuthill and I decided to try our hand at it. The most important skill in attacking this event was quick comprehension. We used Blender for the entirety of the animation - a software infamous for its steep and unforgiving learning curve. With little use of tutorials and no guidance from anyone who knew the software, we slowly began to understand the program. In the end, I had mastered the keyframe animation tools while my partner was well acquainted with the modelling mechanics. I also learned the modelling controls, and produced about a dozen different models that went into the final product. Being able to quickly understand Blender was crucial to our success at the Regional TSA conference, and we hope for further success going forward. I've always found myself quick to understand technology. Around the age of Kindergarten I began using Google and Powerpoint, which eventually led me into my higher understanding of technology that I value today. Throughout the completion of this animation, I further grew this characteristic by taking on one of the most challenging programs I've used, and came out on top.

				Projection

			<p class="bodyText1">
				3D Animation is about as far away from my career destination as possible. I want to go into business, and yet I invested a huge sum of time on an art and modelling project. However, it's crucial as a gifted student that I keep expanding my horizons, trying new things, and expanding my skillset. This project is a great example of pushing my limits. Being able to embrace that concept throughout the rest of my life will allow me to be a more experienced student, more valuable employee, and more knowledgeable person. It's incredibly important to step outside of one's comfort zone, because if you don't, you may never reach your full potential. I never would've known that I'd be able to create an animation like this if I hadn't tried. I highly value a person's diversified portfolio of skills - and this 3D Animation project is one of the most diverse in my portfolio.
