			<br><br>
<p> The International Movie Database defines twenty-four genres of movies. However, these categories forget one crucial type of movie &ndash; the Christmas movie. As families settle in together around the fire for a long winter season, mugs filled with steaming cocoa, cradled in warm, soft sweaters, it is common American practice to watch a seasonally themed movie. We watch Christmas movies as a family, during a season where love and generosity reign supreme. We watch these movies to entertain ourselves with glowing stories of mankind&rsquo;s goodwill, whether that takes the form of an elf exploring the streets of New York to be finally re-accepted by his dad or a cartoon reindeer finding usefulness as a misfit. It makes sense, then, that Christmas movies are those which embody the Christmas spirit, reminding us of love, generosity, kindness, and charity.</p>
<br>
<p>According to the Scientific American Anthropology Blog, the phrase &lsquo;Christmas spirit&rsquo; refers to the collective sentiments of charity, joy, and peace. Every Christmas movie meets the basic qualification of occurring at Christmastime; Christmas movies also embrace the Christmas atmosphere with Santa hats, ornaments, trees, snow, and carols. Most importantly though, they serve a very important purpose for the viewer &ndash; to kindle the sense of Christmas within all of mankind. This is where John McTiernan&rsquo;s <em>Die Hard</em> falls short of being a Christmas movie.</p>
<br>
<p>For those who consider <em>Die Hard </em>a Christmas classic, their first argument will be that the movies takes place on Christmas. This statement alone is incorrect &ndash; technically the movie only takes place on Christmas Eve. But even so, being set at Christmastime does not qualitatively make something a Christmas movie. Billy Wilder&rsquo;s <em>The Apartment</em>, Tim Burton&rsquo;s <em>Edward Scissorhands, </em>Richard Donner&rsquo;s <em>Lethal Weapon, </em>and Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> all take place during the Christmas season and embrace the Christmas atmosphere. Yet none of these films ever appear on &lsquo;Top 10 Christmas movie&rsquo; lists, simply because they fail to leave viewers with a sense of the Christmas spirit. Furthermore, a 2017 YouGov poll of over 5,000 people found that only 31% of respondents consider a movie set at Christmas to be, qualitatively, a Christmas movie.</p>
<br>
<p> In fact, Christmas isn&rsquo;t even an integral part of the <em>Die Hard</em> plot. The movie could play out the same way on any other holiday. John McClane might just as well be visiting for New Year&rsquo;s, Thanksgiving, one of the children&rsquo;s birthdays, or any other holiday. The Nakatomi Corporation could be having a party for any other reason &ndash; a promotion, company success, or practically any holiday. In fact, why would a company have a late-night party on Christmas Eve in the first place? It doesn&rsquo;t actually matter that local businesses are closed, because the boys in blue are eventually alerted of the situation anyway. This is opposed to actual Christmas movies like <em>Home Alone</em>, where Kevin must hide in the nativity and uses Christmas decorations to defend his house, or <em>Love Actually</em>, where Jamie is driven to propose to Aurelia &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s Christmas&rdquo;, Billy Mack aspires to be the number-one <em>Christmas </em>hit, and where a nativity play draws all of the characters together.</p>
<br>
<p>Another element that <em>Die Hard </em>lacks is the use of children &ndash; in fact, most popular Christmas movies rely heavily on the children in the story. <em>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life </em>has Zuzu, <em>Home Alone</em> has Kevin, <em>Christmas Story </em>has Ralphie, <em>Elf </em>features Buddy&rsquo;s endearing younger brother Michael, and <em>Love Actually </em>has love-struck Sam. In contrast, the children in <em>Die Hard</em> aren&rsquo;t even remotely memorable, and could be cut from the movie entirely and it would still be the same film. Here again <em>Die Hard</em> fails to encompass the vibes that viewers rely on in a Christmas movie.</p>
<br>
<p> The best case to be made for <em>Die Hard</em> conveying the Christmas spirit is the conclusion in which John and his wife are re-united. Yes, seeing the movie&rsquo;s primary relationship evolve from hostility to romance qualifies as &lsquo;love&rsquo;, but Holly and John are only seen together in a romantic capacity for 59 seconds of screen time (keep in mind <em>Die Hard </em>has a run time of 7,920 seconds). This part of the plot is far from being the most memorable in the movie. Viewers are more likely to remember the film&rsquo;s catchphrase, &lsquo;Yippie ki yay [expletive]&rsquo;, or the scene in which Hans Gruber falls to his death, or that in which Powell saves McClane by shooting a blood-soaked vengeful terrorist, none of which particularly invoke feelings of charity, joy, or peace. The very goal of an action movie is to keep viewers filled with suspense on the edge of their seats. A movie which contains two amusingly incompetent thieves can still end on a heart-warming note; a SWAT team bursting through the windows of a family dinner only adds to the comical joy of <em>National Lampoon&rsquo;s Christmas Vacation; </em>a film littered with SWAT cars, helicopter gunships, German terrorists, falling corpses, C-4 explosives, the attempted murder of a group of hostages, machine guns, and seventeen homicides is hard-pressed to fill viewers with love, generosity, and kindness.</p>
<br>
<p> <em>Die Hard</em> is only a Christmas movie because people like having an action movie to whip out at Christmastime. Many adults would never consider watching something sappy like <em>White Christmas </em>or <em>It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life</em>, and are far too old for <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>, so <em>Die Hard</em> provides a perfect thrilling film for the season. The setting initially caused some people to consider it a Christmas movie, and society very quickly threw <em>Die Hard</em> into Christmas movie boxes and top 10 lists. Acting as Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs, people have been fooled by association &ndash; watching a movie at Christmas, and associating it with Christmastime, even though the movie itself fails to meet the definition of a Christmas movie. The difference between tradition and festivity is crucial. Just because a family watches <em>Die Hard </em>at Christmas every year, and it puts you in the Christmas mood, the violence and heart-pounding suspense of the movie counteract what Christmas is really about. If you had a custom of going hunting each year at Christmas, it may help develop your seasonal mood, but distracts you from the intentions of Christmas and the Christmas spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>A Christmas movie is not about setting, atmosphere, or songs. Christmas movies are those designed to help catalyze the Christmas spirit in their viewers, inspiring charity, joy, and peace - something that <em>Die Hard</em>, an intense, violent, and incredibly graphic film, simply cannot do.</p></p></div>
