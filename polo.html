				Characters
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				<b>Polo Player</b><br>
				The basic polo player rides a horse and swings a club, and has average stats.<br>
				Their club attack has a short range and moderate strength.<br>
				<b>Xtra Terrestrial</b><br>
				The spaceship character is fast, but is slow to turn and accelerate.<br>
				When holding down LMB, they activate a tractor beam which slowly pulls the ball towards them.<br>
				<b>PoloPro3000</b><br>
				The robot character has average stats.<br>
				Their attack shoots a lazer projectile, that strongly deflects the ball when hitting it.<br>
				<b>General Hartmann</b><br>
				The tank character has a slow speed and turning rate, but powerful fire.<br>
				Their attack shoots a large slow bullet, that very strongly deflects the ball when hitting it.<br>
				<b>Oof</b><br>
				Oof is a dinosaur-riding caveman with a club and average stats.<br>
				Oof's club-swing is more effective than the generic Polo Player at hitting the ball away.<br>
				<b>-classified-</b><br>
				This information has been redacted in the interest of national security.<br>
				--- --- --- - --------- ---- -- ---- --- ---- ------- ------- ---- -----.<br>
				<b>Polo Man</b><br>
				Polo Man is a extremely agile polo-playing superhero.<br>

				Reflection
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				Before my team and I began working on Battle Polo, we had limited success in video game development. In a span of 5 years, I had never before even gotten a top 5 at the TSA Regional conference. With Battle Polo, we decided to step up in a big way. Whereas previous games used 2D graphics, little coding, no animation, and a few simple gameplay mechanics, Battle Polo is an amalgam of the skills of the team. In producing this game, I programmed all the game controls, multiplayer functionality, and gameplay differences, formatted and connected the user interfaces, coded the AI opponents, setup lighting, animated the 2D cutscenes, helped choose and mix songs, and assisted with the 3D modelling. The collection of all these skills and more led Battle Polo to win first at our regional conference - an incredibly satisfying result for the whole team. I enjoyed being able to meet with the team and set ambitious goals, knowing that we had the drive and talent to compelte them, and as we continue to develop this game I hope we will continue with the humor and motivation to fulfill our goals of success.

				Projection
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				Looking forward, the whole team expects Battle Polo to be a success. But beyond that, the skills involved in making this game have set the team up for success in other areas. Even while Battle Polo is under development, I've been experimenting with ideas for other games, and I've found that producing gameplay demos is significantly easier having already learned the ins and outs of higher-quality game development. Crafting Battle Polo led me throughout many forums and guides, as well as forcing me to engage my entire problem-solving skillset. As a result, most bugs or issues I encounter in the future, I'll already have solved while making Battle Polo. Some other ideas I've entertained include an anime vacuum cleaner dating simulator (which, with its comedic value, would benefit greatly from the over-the-top dramatic cutscene style developed in Battle Polo); Another idea that my team and I considered was a multiplayer web-based game wherin the user controls a spaceship and travels a galaxy, mining resources, and fighting other players. This space-style MMO would be considerably quick to produce, given the knowledge of multiplayer communications that Battle Polo gave me. Another idea I'm considering is a low-poly, humorous game set in a shopping mall, where the user attempts comically elaborate shoplifting - for example, trying to sneak out of a department store with a grand piano. Regardless of where my creative drive takes me next, the knowledge of game development and problem-solving I've developed with my role in Battle Polo will make it achievable.
