			<h3>
				What Is It?
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				What proposition could the intellectual behind words on a webpage possibly provide me today? What's worth reading the perhaps frighteningly lengthy body of text to come? What do the words "Presenter's Dilemma" even mean? All these questions could possibly be answered below.
				<br><br>
				As the name of the page suggests, what I've conceieved to be truth is a dilemma. The presenter's dilemma. Seeing as a search for the phrase, and subsequent searches for the concept, only return a disappointing "Did you mean: Prisoner's dilemma?" (which, by the way, is an excellent explanation of the fascinating subject of Game Theory), I'm going to assume that my argument of this topic is original.
				<br><br>
				The presenter's dilemma is a problem in the function of our society best explained through example. Suppose that you are sitting in a lecture hall, alongside 300 other students. The professor, feeling utterly uninterested on a Monday morning, decides that the best use of the class is a 10-minute long anecdote about his morning.
				<br><br>
				Being the apt listener that you are, you find yourself engrossed in the story. The other 300 students, however, find the 10-minute long story a complete waste of their time. The most important element here is the professor himself. From his perspective, he just narrated a 10-minute long story. Obviously, that narration was an expense of just 10-minutes of his own time.
				<br><br>
				Consider now the 300-person audience, uninterested in the story but obligated to sit through it. Each of them individually has spent 10-minutes listening to the story, but combined, they have spent<br><br>
			</p>
				<b><pre><center>
10 minutes * 300 students = 3,000 collective minutes
				</center></pre></b><br><br>
			<p class="bodyText1">
				Which, when simplified, is over Two Days of collective time exhausted by a 10-minute tale. We'll assume, in this example, that since the professor enjoyed sharing his story and you enjoyed listening to it that those 20 minutes of time were not wasted.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Why Does It Matter?
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				So what?, you may be asking youself, feeling awfully unenlightened. Consider, for emphasis, another situation. This time, a situation more disastrous than a simple lecture-hall incident. An audience of 2,000 gathers for some significant occasion. Any venue for such an occasion obviously has some expectation of capacity and profecient functionality, but anyone can agree that occasionally unforseen difficulties can arise. 
				<br><br>
				In this example, the speaker system in a stadium has completely broken, and the event cannot proceed until it is fixed. Assuming the exellence of the repair crew, the problem is rectified within 5 minutes, postponing the start of the event by, what at first may seem, an insignificant amount. There's a good chance you have encountered such a situation, maybe worse in measure, or maybe in such a simple manner that it didn't catch your attention, but such an incident is common enough to warrant the attention of this argument.
				<br><br>
				Applying the same calculations for collective time exhausted, 5 minutes * 2,000 people = 10,000 minutes. A sum which is equivelant to just under a week's time. So, in an apparently trivial situation, almost a week of potential human productivity has been lost.
				<br><br>
				The problem here is lost time. Wasted time. Time devoured by simple affairs which adds up to devastating capacities.
			</p>

			<h3>
				What's So Important About Time?
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				I believe the whole of history on Earth allows me to conclude that humans are the most accomplished species, and the species that can do the most when we're given resources, motivation, time, and energy. Collectively, we've achieved success beyond measure. That's why the presenter's dilemma measures collective time. An individual man could never have built Babylon, or the Great Pyramids, or Rome or Paris or London or Boston. So yes, alone, one's time has considerably less value. When a group as large as 2,000, 300, or even 20 people is removed from a productive capacity due to the flaws of a presenter or when put at the mercy of a select few, their time is dilapidated.
				<br><br>
				In a week's worth of human time, a gross amount of productive capability can be expressed. A week could become drafting a book, creating a website or software, earning 800+ dollars (according to a rough mean weekly salary), 5 days of education, attending classes to learn a new skill, creating a new recipe, budgeting, cleaning, animating, modelling, painting, drawing, weaving - any number of things. Just, for example, consider all the things you could achieve in a week.
				<br><br>
				Better yet, consider the number of things you could do in a day. Or even finer still - contemplate what you could do in simply an hour. A search of "Skills to learn in one hour" yields a plethora of blogs trying to occupy the free time of their readers. Some examples include learning to code, learning to play guitar or ukelele or really any instrument, reading backwards, interpreting the korean alphabet, etc. There's an Amazon-owned site by the name of Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which users can perform Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) for minute amounts of money in minute amounts of time.
				<br><br>
				Further still, I've found endless articles detailing skills to learn within a minute, although I'm going to assume you get the points. Humans are incredible creatures. We're capable of alot with our time. This problem - the presenter's dilemma - is a massive offender in wasting our time. The reason I'm writing this? We don't even realize it.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Why Does It Happen?
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				The presenter's dilemma is spawned out of the simple imbalance of an individual person or small group of people addressing a much larger gathering as an audience. The presenter only considers their own time, while they should be considering the collective time exhausted by the audience. The presenter is in complete control of a huge group of people, and in the wrong hands that control can lead to devastating losses.
				<br><br>
				That's not to claim that all presenters waste the time of their audience - that would be both inaccurate and insulting to those public speakers adept enough to recognize this problem. The issue is, as it is in many of society's flaws, ignorance. Perhaps if that was not the root of the problem, this solution wouldn't be sprawling out of my hands.
				<br><br>
				In some cases the issue occurs because a presenter becomes addicted to the control derived from speaking to a large audience. In some cases the personal narrative, in the mind of the speaker, takes precedence over the time of their audience. This problem is only amplified with a captive audience, as in a classroom.
				<br><br>
				Audience size is also essential to the problem. With a larger audience size, the amount of collective time abused becomes amplified. Suppose, in this extreme situation, that the President of the USA goes on a 30 second tangent in his State of the Union address, out of a miscalculation in its necessity to his deliverance. 31.7 million people watch the address, so using the same calculations...
			</p>
				<b><br><br><pre><center>
30 seconds * 31.7 million viewers = 951,000,000 seconds
951,000,000 seconds / 60 = 15,850,000 minutes
15,850,000 minutes / 60 = 264,166 hours
264,166 hours / 24 = 11,006 days
11,006 days / 7 = 1,572 weeks
1,572 weeks / 52 = 30 years

30 years * $45,000 (rough mean annual salary) ~= $1,324,440
				</center></pre></b><br><br>
			<p class="bodyText1">
				Now this conclusion is an extremely large one to make, but with a 30 second sidenote, the President of the United States has spent 30 years of collective human time. That's real power right there.
			</p>

			<h3>
				What Should We Do?
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				The plain and simple to solution to solving the presenter's dilemma is to acknowledge it, and to always strive as a presenter to balance your own interests and those of your audience. Do not assume your audience as unconditionally interested ears, bound to your voice. 
				<br><br>
				Instead, always consider your audience, at least in part, to be human beings, capable of great things, always prioritizing effeciency. Adjust your presentation, style, and behavior accordingly. Avoid trivial matters, or those which do not directly concern the whole of your audience.
				<br><br>
				Some of it relates to simple manners. If you absolutely wish to speak about an unrelated topic, or one which does not concern the whole of your audience, do it in a fashion wherein those unassociated or unfascinated by your topic have the option to leave. Never hold an audience captive if your subject matter misuses their time.
				<br><br>
				My practical tips would be to avoid meetings which simply review information. Seek, to the best of your ability, not to waste time repeating (anything), but instead to only review when your audience requests it. A flaw which often leads directly to the presenter's dilemma is the assumption by speakers (especially teachers and professors) that the audience wishes them to review information by default.
			</p>

			<h3>
				In Summary
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				The presenter's dilemma is a problem we face wherein a speaker does not recognize the audience's interest in time. They consider, not out of malicious intent, but out of ignorance and the basic nature of a presenter, their time to be the primary issue. Ignorance is the problem, so as is enlightenment the solution. Always strive as a presenter to recognize the importance of your audience's collective time, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you. Practice manners when presenting, and do so effectively and with effeciency.
				<br><br>
				The presenter's dilemma, simply put, is when a speaker unintentionally wastes the time of their audience. So it's a good thing you're only reading this.
