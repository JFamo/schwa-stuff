			<h3>
				Inspiration
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				I should first note that this game is based off of an article on a Tetris-playing AI found here : <a href="https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/">Tetris AI</a> by Yiyuan Lee. The tetris game I used is forked from jakesgordon on GitHub, licensed as open-source software found here : <a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris">JavaScript Tetris</a> by jakesgordon. To try to beat Khan, you can play the tetris game located at this link : <a href="https://codeincomplete.com/games/tetris/">JavaScript Tetris Game</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>
				The Game
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				Essentially, I started this project by assessing the Tetris engine setup by jakesgordon, realizing that existing methods to find whether a spot was occupied or not, and to find where a piece currently resides, could be utilized in making an AI to play the game.
				<br><br>
				The first thing I did was duplicate the blocks object into a 'fakeblocks' object - so that the AI could simulate possible moves without actually changing the real game board. I then wrote a method to be called each time a new block appears, wherein Khan assesses each possible column. He next finds the lowest point that the given block could fall to in that column, and assesses it for each rotation. For every possible move that would fit, Khan calculates a 'score' to determine whether that move is the best one available to him or not.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Heuristics and Move Assessment
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				The main influence when deciding on heuristics for the metaheuristic was the article by Yiyuan Lee - using 4 heuristics to weigh the value of an individual move. They are :
				<br><br>
				Aggregate Height - the cumulative height of each column
				<br>
				Complete Lines - the number of complete lines
				<br>
				Holes - the number of holes in the grid
				<br>
				Bumpiness - the difference in heights from one column to the next
				<br><br>
				Using these heuristics, I setup Khan with a score function such that the score of a move is equal to a weight multiplied by each of the heuristic values. What makes the AI learn is by adjusting those weighted values, varying which factors are most important to the AI. One version of Khan might care more about not creating any holes - one might care most about keeping the grid flat.
			</p>

			<h3>
				The Genetic Algorithm
			</h3>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				Khan is initialized with a population of 2 vectors, each containing 4 values - a weight for each of the 4 heuristics. Those 2 individuals are then crossed-over into a new individual, and a random chance at mutation is applied. The new individual is then added to the population, along with the score they received.
				<br><br>
				At the start of each new game, Khan finds the 'fittest' (highest-scoring) two individuals in the population, and uses them for crossover. Mutation allows for Khan to try new weights, evolving away from the population, which occurs at a 20% chance for each weight.
			</p>
